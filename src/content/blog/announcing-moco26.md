We are thrilled to announce that MOCO’26, the 10th International Conference on Movement and Computing, will be held at Cité des Arts (Montpellier’s conservatory), in Montpellier, France, from Thursday 23th to Saturday 25th of April 2026.

MOCO'26 is organised by EuroMov Digital Health in Motion, a joint research unit between the University of Montpellier and IMT Mines Ales, based on three areas of expertise: Human Movement Sciences, Digital Sciences and Health Sciences.

In addition to previous topics of MOCO (Movement + Computing), this edition will provide a special focus on health applications. The MOCO’26 local organizing committee includes Patrice Guyot and Grégoire Bosselut (Conference co-Chairs), Stéphane Perrey, Gérard Dray and Leonardo Montecchia (Program Chair) and Julie Boiché (partnerships and subscription).
